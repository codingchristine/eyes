# Eyes
Class assignment in MIT Full Stack class to make eyes move with mouse

## Requirements
A text or code editor, such as Visual Studio.  

## Project Notes
In this assignment we used JavaScript to track the movement of the mouse on the screen and move the HTML elements on the page (styled with CSS) to follow the mouse.

## How to Run
If you'd like to use, you can download the files, open them in your browser or upload to your project and it should work. Customize any way you'd like.

## Next Steps
To further improve this set of code, I want to try to make the eyes blink on click.
